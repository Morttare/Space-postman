Lost_Person: *crying*
Postman_in_kela: What's wrong? What's your name?
Lost_Person: I'm Vagrant and I can't find the right desk. I have been crying so much I can't even read the soaken queue number anymore.
Postman_in_kela: Oh… I'm sorry. Why are you crying?
Lost_Person: AstroSure has taken everything from me.
Lost_Person: I used to have a nice little hut on Kelarot-7. I was able to afford it with housing benefit.
Lost_Person: One day I just suddenly stopped receiving the benefit.
Lost_Person: I sent letters and forms. But nobody answered back.
Lost_Person: Eventually, they kicked me out since I couldn't afford the place.
Lost_Person: not just from the building… but the planet.
Lost_Person: I'm not welcome there anymore.
Lost_Person: And despite what the receptionist said it is hard to feel welcome here either.
Postman_in_kela: Oof. That sounds rough.
Lost_Person: Yeah… I miss home.
Lost_Person: I regret I was so quiet and didn't reach out to people when I had the chance.
Lost_Person: Also I regret that I left my phone there.
Lost_Person: It has been SO boring here without it.
Postman_in_kela: Right.
Postman_in_kela: Well, don't worry! My job is to deliver mail.
Postman_in_kela: Give me your letter and I'll make sure it arrives safely to its destination.
Lost_Person: Wow! Thank you! Finally I'm free from this maze!

Postman_in_kela: No problem!
Postman_in_kela: Into the maze I go. What where the directions again??
